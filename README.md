# üß© Pok√©mon Card App

Welcome to the **Pok√©mon Card App**!  
This project was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate clean coding practices, real-time API integration, responsive UI design, and modern React development using **Tailwind CSS**.

The app fetches live Pok√©mon data from **PokeAPI** and allows users to **search**, **filter by type**, and view detailed Pok√©mon **stats** ‚Äî all wrapped up in a beautiful, responsive UI!
